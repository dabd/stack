# Stack

1. Implement a stack with push, pop, peek, and isEmpty methods using a linked list.
2. Additionally implement:

    2.1 *duplicate*: the top element is duplicated

    2.2 *swap*: top two items
       
    2.3 *rotate n*: the topmost n elements so the topmost element becomes the nth from the top,
       the second from the top becomes the top, etc.
       
    2.4 *popN*: pop n elements from the stack
